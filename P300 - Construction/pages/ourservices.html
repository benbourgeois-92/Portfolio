	<img src="../images/photos/green-construction.jpg" width="60%">
	<p>As the federal government has become a major player in the construction industries demanding Green Construction and reducing energy consumption, those of us in the construction industry are compelled to become more environmentally responsible. Even though Green Construction increases the cost of construction on the front end, it benefits to you as the homeowner include decreased operating cost of your home overtime. When considering your next construction project we strongly recommend that you consult with a certified licensed contractor.</p>
	<h2>HVAC Energy Star</h2>
	<p>According to studies the third most expensive purchase within oneâ€™s lifetime is a new heating and air conditioning system, following the purchase of your home as the first and your automobile as the second. Today many HVAC manufactures are offering from ten-years to life time warranties on their equipment brands when properly installed by a certified licensed HVAC contractor.  As of 2009, the minimum efficiency equipment that can be manufactured in the United States is 13 SEER system, this efficiency upgrade has increased the cost for a new HVAC system greatly. </p>
	<p>When considering your next comfort system we strongly recommend that you consult a certified licensed heating & a/c professional to install your next comfort system.  Planning ahead will assure you reap the benefits in energy cost and equipment warranty that you deserve for your investment.</p>
